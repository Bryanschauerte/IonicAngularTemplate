# IonicAngularTemplate
A template for starting a web app using Angular and Ionic

A blank app from the template http://ionicframework.com/getting-started/  side menu. 
To add new style, go to myApp/scss/ionic.app.scss. 
To manipulate the boilerPlate styles go to myApp/www/lib/ionic/scss/Whatever-type. The main colors come from the file at 
myApp/www/lib/ionic/scss/_variables.scss

For a great introduction to Hooks, I highly recommend Holly Schinsky's 'DevGirl's Webblog', particularly http://devgirl.org/2013/11/12/three-hooks-your-cordovaphonegap-project-needs/

Angular code belongs in the /www/js folder.
If you are new to Angular, Check out their documentation and then for structure help - http://www.johnpapa.net/structuring-an-angular-project/

If you hit any snags or need help with terminal commands, check out Ionics documents.
